# Basics of Prompt Engineering

**Note:** The following images show actual results from watsonx.ai. The gray text is what we provided to the model. The blue highlighted text is how the model responded.

### 1.0 LLM Foundations
Before we jump into exploring the capabilities of Prompt Lab, we first need to lay a foundation for how Large Language Models (LLMs) work, and how we can tune the model and parameters to change their output. Gaining this understanding will make us more effective at prompt engineering.
